Here is a simple implementation of the game of life using ATS and Bacon JS.<br />

First specify your grid size. Then click on the grid to draw a configuration of living cells. The click "Simulate" followed
by "Simulate Once".<br />

What you can also do:<br />

1. You can make a cell alive or kill a cell at any point during the simulation.<br />
2. You can add predefined templates.<br />
3. You can create very very very basic logic gates of no more than 2 non negated Literals in the case of AND & OR,<br />
   and 1 Literal in the case of a NOT gate. Just choose youre gate, then type your values in the text box
   in the form of "TF" (they have to be capitalized and not seperated by a space). Finally press Logic build.
4. Reset the grid at any time, and press STOP in order to stop the simulation completely.<br />
5. Create a Random configuration.<br />
6. Select whether you'd like a Toroidal grid, or a grid where out of bound cells are considered dead.<br/>
